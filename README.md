# React-Seed (Server-side Edition):
Just a quick-start application for small projects, prototyping, and hackathons. Compiled with babel, it assumes development will happen with ES6. Styles are rendered via PostCSS (with PreCSS).

This seed also comes equipped with react-router 1.0 for routing, and amplify-store for client session management.

This server-side seed is very much a work in progress. Use at your own peril. Improvements generally start in my [client-side seed](https://github.com/matthewoden/react-client), then migrate to this one.

##Installation
Clone the repo:

```git clone https://github.com/matthewoden/react-seed.git```

### Node:
Install Node Dependancies:

```npm install```


##Changelog
October 12th - Update to PostCSS, update dependancies.

##Roadmap
